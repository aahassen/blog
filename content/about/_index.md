I am Ahmedin Hassen - I am a proud Dad and I have a passion for programming, but nothing beats being a DAD:) I want to make my son proud by building cool stuff and put them on the internet. I am saying ``` Teaching is new Learning``` because I want to learn and keep myself up-to-date with new technologies and frameworks.The best way to learn is bloging, because it enforces me to read a lot and really understand the subject before I blog about it. Division is the crazy mathimatics when I share it multiply. I first started to blog to share my knowleged but instead of my knowledge being shared it actually multilies. That is why I am saying division is crazy.   I have a masters gegree in software engineering and i have 10 years of software design and development experiese. I hold varies java certifications and I am AWS certified solutions architect-Professional. Iâ€™m the founder of [```FOYAT TECHNOLOGY```](https://foyat.com). If you need software development, design, maintainance and migration project please contact us. We think we can help.
