Selam! I am Ahmedin Hassen - a software engineer/architect. I have a passion for programming. For the past 8 years, I have built dozens of enterprise applications using Java/J2EE technologies for companies like **Accenture**, **NASA**, **CapitalOne**, **NOAA** ..etc. Iâ€™m the founder of [**```FOYAT TECHNOLOGY```**](https://foyat.com), a software consulting company, and hey! make sure you check my company's website out and see if we can add values to your business. <br>
 I Hold Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from University of Gondar and Master's Degree in Software Engineering from the University of Maryland. I am **AWS Certified Solutions Architect(Associate and Professional level)**. <br><br>
**``` Teaching Is The New Learning!```** is my slogan.
I want to learn and keep up with the current trends in Software Development Technologies and Frameworks. The best and effective way to learn is teaching or blogging, because it enforces me to read a lot and really understand the subject before I blog about it. I also wanted to share my knowledge with others and my happiness spikes to the moon when people benefit from my work.
