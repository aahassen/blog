Selam! I am Ahmedin Hassen - a software engineer/architect. I have over 10 years of experience in enterprise applications development using Java/J2EE technologies for companies like **Accenture**, **NASA**, **CapitalOne**, **NOAA** ..etc. My expertise lies in designing, coding, testing and deploying(on-premise and cloud) enterpise applications. I have extensive experience building applications using **N-tier**, **Messaging based**, **plugin-in based and Microservices-based architectures.**

I Hold Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from **University of Gondar** and Master's Degree in Software Engineering from the **University of Maryland**. I am **AWS Certified Solutions Architect-Associate**. <br>
**``` Teaching Is The New Learning!```** is my slogan. I want to learn and keep up with the current trends in Software Development Technologies and Frameworks. I do believe that the best and effective way to learn is teaching or blogging, because it enforces me to read a lot and really understand the subject before I blog about it. I also love to share my knowledge with others so others can benefit from my work.
