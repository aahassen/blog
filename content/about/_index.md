Hey! I am Ahmedin Hassen - a software engineer/Architect. I have a passion for programming. I have built enteriprise applications for companies like **Accenture**, **NASA**, **CapitalOne**, **NOAA** ..etc. <br>
I hold BSC in Computer Science from University of Gondar and Masters degree in Software Engineering from the Univeristy of Maryland. I am **AWS Certified Solutions Architect(Associate and Professional level)**. <br><br>
**``` Teaching is new Learning```**.
I want to learn and keep up with the current trends in software development technologies and frameworks and the best way to learn is bloging, because it enforces me to read a lot and really understand the subject before I blog about it. I also wanted to share knowledge with others and others can benfit from my work and research. Iâ€™m the founder of [```FOYAT TECHNOLOGY```](https://foyat.com), a software consulting company.
